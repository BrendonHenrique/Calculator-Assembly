Introduction
The developed project is a calculator with input values and selection of basic operations through a menu of possibilities.

How it works
The user is prompted to enter a first value, which will be stored in a register. Then, a second value is requested and also stored. With the two values, it is possible to perform an operation.

The user is asked to choose the operation they want to perform. The program then branches the flow to execute the selected operation. After performing the selected operation, the user is asked if they want to continue.

If the user wishes to continue, another value and operator are read, and a new operation is performed. The program then asks again if the user wants to continue. If the user indicates "no" using the menu input character, the result is displayed.
